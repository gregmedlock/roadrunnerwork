This page contain relevant information about how to build !RoadRunner using the MinGW compiler.
= Setup =
Download and install the MinGW compiler from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download?source=files
By default MinGW installs to C:\MinGW.

Next add MinGW's binary folder to your 'PATH', so you can run MinGW commands from the command line, and so that CMake can execute MinGW commands.
MinGW's binary folder is
*C:\MinGW\bin*


= Build Dependencies =
== clapack, version 3.2.1 ==
The source for CLapack, version 3.2.1 is part of the RoadRunner repository, and located in /trunk/ThirdParty/clapack/3.2.1.
To build the clapack libraries, you will need to run CMake UI to create build files. This is explained in the Power Point presentation of RoadRunner.

When getting to the step of compiling clapack, the first problem you may run into is an error regarding 
_EM_DENORMAL plus some others _'are not defined'_ compile errors. 
This is an effect of two headers using the same name in the MingW distribution, namely float.h, contained in MingW/include and another (gcc-specific) see
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3011968&group_id=2435&atid=302435

for a fix.
In short, add 

{{{
#ifdef __MINGW32__
#include_next<float.h>
#endif
}}}

to the end of the float.h header located in
C:\MinGW\lib\gcc\mingw32\4.6.2\include
