#Notes about building RoadRunner with the MinGW compiler

= Introduction =

This page contain relevant information about how to build RoadRunner using the MinGW compiler.
= Setup =
Download the Mingw compiler (from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download?source=files )and install it.
By default MinGW installs to C:\MinGW.

Next add MinGW's binary folder to your 'PATH', so you can run MinGW commands from the command line, and so that CMake can execute MinGW commands.
MinGW's binary folder is
*C:\MinGW\bin*


= Build Dependencies =
== clapack, version 3.2.1 ==

The first problem you may run into is an error regarding _EM_DENORMAL plus some others _'are not defined'_. This is an effect of two headers using the same name in the MingW distribution, namely float.h, contained in MingW/include and another (gcc-specific) see
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3011968&group_id=2435&atid=302435

for a fix.
In short, add 

#ifdef __MINGW32__
#include_next<float.h>
#endif

to the end of the float.h header located in
C:\MinGW\lib\gcc\mingw32\4.6.2\include
