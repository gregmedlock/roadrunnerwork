RoadRunner is distributed as 

1) C++ API: This distribution contains all you need if you are to use roadrunner in a C++ environment.

2) C API:  This distribution contains all you need if you are to use roadrunner in a C environment, or if you are using a tool that need a standard C library (DLL on Windows).

3) Python API: This distribution contains all you need if you are to use roadrunner in a Python environment.

4) FULL: This distribution is containing all of the above.

The "official" releases are being built using Visual Studio 2010, but other releases using other compilers are available too, e.g. CodeGear XE and (later on) MingW
